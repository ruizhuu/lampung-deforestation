# Background: 
Lampung is a province on the Southern tip of Indonesia's third largest Island, Sumatra. Three thirds of this province, 8th most populous, migrated over the years from other more densely populated islands such as Bali, Java, and Sulawesi, as part of the transmigration program. In June 2025, I spent two weeks in East Lampung, conducting research into mangrove restoration and their socio-economic benefits as part of a government of Canada sponsored project.

## Goal
In this project, I wanted to analyze the rates of deforestation in Lampung, and correlated factors. I set out to answer the following questions. 

How does Lampung's deforestation compare to other provinces in Indonesia? 
What are some correlated factors for deforestation? 
What impact does policy have on deforestation?

To answer these questions, I used Global Forest Watch's data on tree cover loss in Indonesia, as well as publicly available data from the Indonesian bureau of statistics, such as business cost index.
