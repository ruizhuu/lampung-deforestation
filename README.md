# Background: 
Lampung is a province on the Southern tip of Indonesia's third largest Island, Sumatra. Three thirds of this province, 8th most populous, migrated over the years from other more densely populated islands such as Bali, Java, and Sulawesi, as part of the transmigration program. In June 2025, I spent two weeks in East Lampung, conducting research into mangrove restoration and their socio-economic benefits as part of a government of Canada sponsored project. 

## Goal
In this project, I wanted to analyze the rates of deforestation in Lampung, and correlated factors. Using Global Forest Watch's data on tree cover loss for Indonesia, I compare deforestation in Lampung to the national standard, as well as other provinces. Additionally, using information from the Bureau of Statistics of Indonesia, I analyze potential correlated factors for deforestation, such as business cost index.
